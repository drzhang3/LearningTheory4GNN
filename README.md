# LearningTheory4GNN
This repo contains some papers about random graph, learning theory on GNNs and some interesting applications about GNNs. 

I am interested in random graph due to its elegant property, which may contributes to the design and improvement of GNNs. **Please feel free to submit a pull request if you want to add good papers. Welcome to contact me for cooperation if there are many overlaps in our research interestsã€‚**
